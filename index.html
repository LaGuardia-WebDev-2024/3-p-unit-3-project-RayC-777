  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Thin/make cuts to your chicken <br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, dried oregano, and garlic powder. <br>
  <strong>Step 3:</strong> Chop the fresh parsley and add it to the beaten eggs. Set up your breading station 
  (flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs). Season the flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs with a pinch of salt 
  and black pepper. <br>
  <strong>Step 4:</strong> Bread the chicken first in the flour, then the beaten eggs, and finally in the breadcrumbs.
  In a pan (large enough for the size of the chicken milanesa) over medium-high heat, add 1 cup of oil. Once the oil is 
  hot (about 350°F/175°C if measuring with a cooking thermometer), add the milanesa and cook for about 2 minutes on each 
  side until golden and cooked through. Once cooked, take it out and dry it on a cooling rack (or on a plate with paper 
  towels). For a classic pairing, as I have done, serve it with a side of crispy French fries.

  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Sift corn starch, 
    self-rising flour and baking powder into a bowl. 
    Add in sugar and mix well. <br>
    
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add in cold butter and
    massage it into the flour with the tips of your 
    fingers until the mixture becomes sand-like. Add 
    in the rest of the ingredients and mix well using a 
    spatula until everything is coming together.<br>

    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour into a floured working 
    surface and lightly knead with your hands to bring 
    everything together into a ball. Don't over knead.  <br>
    
    <strong>Step 4:</strong> Place it back into the bowl, 
    cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for 
    30 minutes. Meanwhile we proceed with the filling.  <br>
    
    <strong>Step 5:</strong> Add quince cubes and water 
    into a pot. Cook on low heat until the cubes melt and becomes 
    a thick paste. Cool completely before using.  <br>
    <strong>Step 6:</strong> Place ¾ of dough in between 2 cling 
    films and roll it into 13 inch (33 cm) disk. Remove the top 
    film and sprinkle some flour on the dough. Swiftly yet confidently flip it 
    into a 12 inch (30.5 cm) glass container that has been buttered and floured. 
    Re-adjust the dough as you need and remove the film. Trim the edges so that 
    it's ½ inch (1.3 cm) tall, more or less. Set aside to chill in the fridge.  <br>
    <strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the remaining dough to make 8 lattice. Roll 
    on floured surface for better handling. Chill in the fridge for a while 
    if the dough is too soft to handle. Pour cooled quince paste into the 
    container and spread evenly. Arrange the lattice on top. Brush the dough 
    with egg yolk. Bake in a preheated oven on the lowest rack at 340ºF (170ºC) 
    for 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and while 
    still hot, brush some jam on the pastry. Finally sprinkle some desiccated coconut 
    on the pastry. Cool completely before slicing. Enjoy! <br>
